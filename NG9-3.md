 - Melted headlight socket's may also cause a problem.  Solution found was to change the headlight connector (https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/39419/causes-of-melted-connector-on-h4-lamp-for-headlight).
### Throttle Body
 - The position sensor inside of the throttle body has been known to fail causing surging and limp home mode problems and check engine light problems indicating a throttle body and a ecu problem.  The recommended solution is to replace the throttle body with a new or used throttle body.
