### ECU failes
 - A remanufactured ECU can be purchased from BBA Reman (http://www.bba-reman.com/us/index.aspx)
 - A new ECU can be purchase for $349 from eEuroparts.com but it still has to be programmed for your specific car (https://www.eeuroparts.com/Parts/52666/Engine-Control-Module-ECM-Trionic-8-ECUSAABT8/)
### Front Grill Insignia Falls Off
 - A new one can be purchased for ~$13.00 from esaabparts (https://www.esaabparts.com/saab/parts/4830071).
### Headlight
 - Often the headlight connections give an issue.  The remedy for this can be found here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iySpgKmkfS8&feature=youtu.be)
 - Another solution can be found as instructions without a video here (http://saabworld.net/showthread.php?t=28630)
 - Melted headlight socket's may also cause a problem.  Solution found was to change the headlight connector (https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/39419/causes-of-melted-connector-on-h4-lamp-for-headlight).
 - Another solution might be a new or repaired relay (http://saabworld.net/showthread.php?t=24518).
### OBD Port Fails to Connect
 - Obd port not working - Sweedish Auto of NYC reports that is a do-it-yourself repair. Pull out pin, straighten, put it back in. The pins apparently have a tendency of sliding out of the back of the connector (https://www.saabcentral.com/threads/2007-9-3-aero-2-8-obd2-dead.213842/#/topics/213842?page=2)
 - Another issue can be a blown fuse (https://www.saabcentral.com/threads/no-obd-communications.212566/#/topics/212566).
### Gas Pedal Recalibration
 - In these cars the gas pedals sometimes need to be recalibrated (http://www.saabcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=217566)
 - With the car off and codes cleared. Have the key in your hand. Push the pedal all the way 100% to the floor. Insert the key and start the car. The engine will not accelerate. After the car starts and runs at proper idle take foot off of the accelerator and allow the pedal to return to zero % position. The calibration is now complete.
### Throttle Body
 - The position sensor inside of the throttle body has been known to fail causing surging and limp home mode problems and check engine light problems indicating a throttle body and a ecu problem.  The recommended solution is to replace the throttle body with a new or used throttle body.
 - A new throttle body can be purchased from eEuroparts.com for $556 (https://www.eeuroparts.com/Parts/31358/Throttle-Body-93189207/).
